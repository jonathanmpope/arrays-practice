# Self-Evaluation

1. I'm feeling pretty confident on arrays. I used them quite a bit, including some of the same methods with javascript. The syntax is different, so that is a bit of a learning curve.
1. I don't feel like I need any additional learning. I took a lot of notes and feel confident with what I learned.
1. When you use methods like .shift, that remove elements, are those returned as a new array or variable?
